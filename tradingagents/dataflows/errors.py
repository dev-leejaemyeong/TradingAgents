"""Vendor data-error taxonomy.

A single hierarchy so the routing layer reacts by *behavior*, not by vendor:
every condition where a vendor cannot return usable data derives from
``VendorError``, and the router catches the base types. A new vendor raises
these (or a thin vendor-named subclass) and needs no new ``except`` clause.

    VendorError
    ├── NoMarketDataError          no usable rows (empty result OR stale data)
    ├── VendorRateLimitError       transient throttle -> skip to next vendor
    ├── VendorNotConfiguredError   missing API key/config -> vendor unavailable
    └── VendorNotEntitledError     valid key, but plan doesn't cover this endpoint
                                    -> skip to next vendor (permanent, not transient)

The number of types is the number of distinct router reactions, not the number
of human-describable causes: empty and stale data get identical handling, so
they share ``NoMarketDataError`` and differ only in the free-text ``detail``.
