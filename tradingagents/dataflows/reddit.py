"""Reddit search fetcher for ticker-specific discussion posts.

Default path is Reddit's public Atom/RSS search feed
(``reddit.com/r/{sub}/search.rss``). The richer JSON search endpoint
(``/search.json``) is reliably WAF-blocked (``HTTP 403``) for public clients
(issue #862), and probing it on every call only doubled our request volume
against Reddit's per-IP rate limit — tripping ``429`` on the RSS fallback — so
it is kept (``_fetch_subreddit_json``) but not used by default. On a 429 we
back off and retry up to twice (honouring ``Retry-After``), widened from a
single retry 2026-07-29 after a real run still exhausted it on two
subreddits back-to-back. RSS lacks score / comment counts, so those posts
are marked and the formatter omits the metrics rather than printing fake
zeros.

No API key required (unauthenticated requests top out around 10/min per IP,
vs. 100/min for an OAuth-registered app — see TODOS.md for the pending OAuth
registration, which needs Reddit's 2-4 week manual approval). Returns
formatted plaintext blocks ready for prompt injection and degrades
gracefully — returns a placeholder string rather than raising, so callers
never special-case missing data. A fetch that fails outright is worded as
"data unavailable", distinct from a genuinely empty result — conflating the
two previously let a rate-limited fetch read to the LLM as confirmed market
silence (2026-07-29 finding).
